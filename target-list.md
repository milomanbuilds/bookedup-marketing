# Target List: Local Contractors

## How to Find Contacts

### Method 1: Google Maps

2. Click on each business
3. Look for:
   - Business name
   - Website (check contact page for emails)
   - Phone number
   - Owner name (often in reviews or About section)

### Method 2: Yelp
1. Search for contractors in your area
2. Filter by "Claimed" businesses (they're more likely to respond)
3. Check business websites for contact info

### Method 3: Industry Directories
- HomeAdvisor
- Angi (formerly Angie's List)
- Thumbtack
- Local Chamber of Commerce

### Method 4: Facebook Groups
Search for:

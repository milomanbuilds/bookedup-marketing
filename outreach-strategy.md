## Email Sequence

### Email 1: The Hook (Day 1)
**Subject:** Quick question about missed calls

```
Hi [First Name],

I was looking at [Company Name]'s reviews — solid work. 

Quick question: How many calls do you think you miss in a typical week?

Most contractors I talk to say 3-5, and every one of those is money walking to a competitor.

I built Bookedup to fix that — it texts your missed callers back within seconds and gets them booked while you're still on the job.

Worth a 10-minute call to see if it fits your business?

Best,

Founder, Bookedup
P.S. No software to learn. Just more jobs in your calendar.
```

### Email 2: The Social Proof (Day 4)
**Subject:** How [Similar Company] stopped losing leads

```
Hey [First Name],

Following up on my last email about missed calls.

Just helped a plumber in [Nearby City] who was missing 4-5 calls per day. In his first month with Bookedup, he booked 12 jobs he would've lost — paid for the whole year.

The crazy part? He didn't change anything about how he works. Just started capturing the leads he was already getting.

If you're curious how it works: [10-min demo →](https://calendly.com/tomatbookedup/30min)

Or reply with a quick "interested" and I'll send over a 60-second video.

```

### Email 3: The Breakup (Day 8)
**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
[First Name],

I don't want to clutter your inbox if Bookedup isn't a fit right now.

I'll close your file — but if you're still losing calls to voicemail, just reply "keep me posted" and I'll send you our case study when we hit 100 customers.

Either way, best of luck with [Company Name].

Tom
Bookedup

## LinkedIn Connection Script

**Connection Request:**
```
Hi [Name], saw you're a [trade] in [city]. I'm building something to help contractors stop losing leads to missed calls. Would love to connect!
```

**Follow-up Message (after they accept):**
```
Thanks for connecting! Quick question — how do you handle it when you're on a job and can't answer the phone?

Most contractors I know just let it go to voicemail, but that customer usually calls 2-3 other people while they wait.

I built a simple tool that texts missed callers back instantly and gets them booked without you lifting a finger. Worth a quick look?
